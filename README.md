### Naming

  ```

## <a name='branching'>Branching</a>

You must create a new branch when working on a new feature.

  - **master**:
    > The production branch. Must always be stable and deployable.
  - **hotfix**:
    > A temporary branch of master to create hotfixes.
  - **release**:
    > When there are enough iterations in branch 'develop', merge it to branch 'release' for test & checks before merging into the master branch.
  - **develop**:
    > This branch can contain many iterations.
  - **IterationName**:
    > Iteration specific branch.
  - **US-xxxxx**:
    > User Story branch where *xxxxx* is the name of the User Story.

:warning: It is important to make User Story branches independent from the Iteration branch so they can be merged independently into develop branch if needed.
All **US-xxxxx** should therefore be created at the same time from the develop branch or from the `Iteration branch` when it's first created.

Follow the Git-flow works :

## <a name='start-feature'>Start an iteration</a>

```bash
# Fetch commits from remote
$ git fetch origin

# Create an iteration branch
$ git checkout -b IterationName origin/master

# Create an new branch for an user story
$ git checkout -b US-xxxxxx origin/master

# When you're ready, create a pull request following the convention
```

## <a name='commit-message'>Commit message conventions</a>

Commit message must be readable, understandable and write in english.

### Commit message Format

```php
// Simple
<type>(<scope...>): <Description>

// Simple with issue
<type>(<scope...>): <Description>

// Full description
<type>(<scope...>): <Short description>

<Explain more...>
```
For more "fun" use [emojis](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/) :+1:.

### Type

##### Example

```text
feat(RestApiController, Route): add constraint to user profile

Now, each request must provided an email to be correctly executed.

ABC-XXX #closed
```

- **feature**: `feat(ApiController): Add post method for feature A`
    > Should represent a feature commit

- **fix**: `fix(MessageService): fix #12 wrong status code on GET request`
    > Should represent a bug fix<br>
    > Must reference an issue ID

- **style**: `style(ApiController): :lipstick:`
    > Changes that don't affect meaning of the code only white-space, formatting

- **documentation**: `docs(ApiController, MessageService): add documentation in controller + Reword class description for  Service`
    > Should represent a documentation changes

- **refactor**: `refact(MessageService): change message generation process`
    > A change for better readablilty (Don't add feature or fix bug)

- **performance**: `perf(UrlGenerator): Replace libA for libB`
    > Should represent a performance improvement

- **test**: `test(MessageService): Implement message service test for GET request`
    > Should represent a test implementation

- **misc**: `misc(Dockerfile): Change node version to 0.12`
    > Changes that didn't match any other categories

### Use Gitg :bulb:

[Gitg](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gitg) is a graphical user interface for git. It aims at being a small,
fast and convenient tool to visualize the history of git repositories.
Besides visualization, [gitg](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gitg) also provides several utilities to manage your
repository and commit your work.

### Select hunks for better commit

Sometime, in development process you fix a bug when creating feature. And this bug fix isn't really a part of the feature.

```bash
# For example you made changes on ApiController.php
# One for the feature and one for a bug fix
$ git status
    modified:   ApiController.php

# use git commit -pm to select which part to commit
$ git commit -pm 'fix(ApiController): fix a hilarious bug'

You can use many options on every hunk

y - stage this hunk
n - do not stage this hunk
q - quit; do not stage this hunk or any of the remaining ones
a - stage this hunk and all later hunks in the file
d - do not stage this hunk or any of the later hunks in the file
g - select a hunk to go to
/ - search for a hunk matching the given regex
j - leave this hunk undecided, see next undecided hunk
J - leave this hunk undecided, see next hunk
k - leave this hunk undecided, see previous undecided hunk
K - leave this hunk undecided, see previous hunk
s - split the current hunk into smaller hunks
e - manually edit the current hunk

# You can now commit your feature
# Now you can cherry-pick the bug fix to share it with other branch
# without sending feature part

```
